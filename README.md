# NNStatikProjektarbeit
This is the repository for my "Projektarbeit" in the Bachelor of Simulation Technology 

---
The topic is the calculation of displacement and distortions via a neural network which is trained with data from the finit element tool ANSYS

The neural network is designed in MatLab with the toolkits for machine learning and neural network
